Explain why problem formulation must follow goal formulation.

Without values or cares and concerns, there are no problems -- all outcomes are indifferent. 
Assuming values are expressed in goals (rather than, say, in expressive gestures or visionary narrartives), then goals are a requirement for the articulation of problems.
